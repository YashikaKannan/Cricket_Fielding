# üèè Cricket Fielding Performance Analysis

This project analyzes individual fielding contributions of players from a T20 match to assess their overall performance using a weighted scoring system.

## Objective

To calculate the **Performance Score (PS)** of each player based on their fielding actions ‚Äî catches, throws, run outs, etc.

### Dataset Features
- Match No.
- Innings
- Team
- Player Name
- Ballcount
- Position
- Short Description
- Pick (Clean Pick, Drop Catch, Catch, etc.)
- Throw (Run Out, Good Throw, Missed Run Out, etc.)
- Direct Hit
- Runs (Saved or Conceded)
- Overcount
- Venue

### üßÆ Performance Score Formula
PS = (CP√ó1) + (GT√ó2) + (C√ó10) + (DC√ó-10) + (ST√ó8) + (RO√ó10) + (MRO√ó-5) + (DH√ó3) + RS


Where:

- **CP**: Clean Picks  
- **GT**: Good Throws  
- **C**: Catches  
- **DC**: Dropped Catches  
- **ST**: Stumpings  
- **RO**: Run Outs  
- **MRO**: Missed Run Outs  
- **DH**: Direct Hits  
- **RS**: Runs Saved (+) / Conceded (-)
